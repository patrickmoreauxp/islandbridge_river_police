# Islandbridge Police - Steering Division
## Motivation
Islandbridge is a great place to row and has numerous clubs along this particular stretch of the Liffey. Due to this popularity, the river can get **incredibly** busy! Therefore, for safety reasons, it's extremely import to stick to the [rules of the river](https://github.com/patrickmoreauxp/islandbridge_river_police/blob/master/data/islandbridge_river_rules.png). 

Arguably, the most important rule is Rule 3, which states:
 
> KEEP to the SOUTH station going upstream

> KEEP to the NORTH station doing downstream

> KEEP out of the middle of the river

Unfortuantely, we often have quite poor 'steerspeople' in Islandbridge. So, the purpose of this repo is to use Strava GPS data to allow people to evaluate their own steering (and expose the worst offenders).
